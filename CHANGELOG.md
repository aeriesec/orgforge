# Changelog

All notable changes to OrgForge will be documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v0.1.2] — 2026-03-04

### Changed

- **`_generate_theme()` switched from `PLANNER_MODEL` to `WORKER_MODEL`**
  Theme generation requires only a single sentence output and does not benefit
  from the planner's capacity. Using the 1.5b worker model reduces per-day
  overhead significantly given `_generate_theme()` fires every simulated day.
  _File: `flow.py` — `Flow._generate_theme()`_

### Added

- **Timeout parameter on `OllamaLLM`** — explicit `timeout` value added to
  `build_llm()` to prevent `litellm.Timeout` errors on slower hardware where
  CPU-bound generation can exceed the default 600s limit.
  _File: `flow.py` — `build_llm()`_

## [v0.1.1] — 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- **`TypeError: SimEvent.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument '_id'`**
  MongoDB documents fetched via `.find()` in `recall_events()` include internal
  fields (`_id`, `embedding`) that are not defined on the `SimEvent` dataclass.
  These fields are now stripped before constructing `SimEvent` objects.
  _File: `memory.py` — `Memory.recall_events()`_

- **`NameError: name 'prop' is not defined` in `_print_final_report()`**
  The `prop` variable returned by `graph_dynamics.propagate_stress()` was scoped
  locally to `_end_of_day()` but referenced in `_print_final_report()`. It is now
  stored as `self._last_stress_prop` and accessed safely via `hasattr` guard to
  handle runs that exit before `_end_of_day()` is called.
  _File: `flow.py` — `Flow._end_of_day()`, `Flow._print_final_report()`_

### Added

- **`Memory.reset(export_dir=None)`** — clears MongoDB `artifacts` and `events`
  collections, resets the in-memory `_event_log`, and optionally wipes the export
  directory. Re-attaches the `FileHandler` to a fresh `simulation.log` after the
  wipe so logging continues uninterrupted.
  _File: `memory.py`_

- **`--reset` CLI flag** — passing `--reset` when invoking `flow.py` triggers
  `Memory.reset()` with the configured `BASE` export directory before the
  simulation starts, ensuring MongoDB and `/export` always represent the same run.
  _File: `flow.py`_

## [v0.1.0] — 2026-03-01

### Added

- Initial release of the OrgForge simulation engine
- MongoDB vector search memory layer (`memory.py`) with Ollama, OpenAI, and AWS
  Bedrock embedding providers
- CrewAI-based daily simulation loop with incident detection, sprint planning,
  standups, retrospectives, and postmortem generation (`flow.py`)
- NetworkX social graph with stress propagation and edge decay (`graph_dynamics.py`)
- Export to Confluence, JIRA, Slack, Git PR, and email artifact formats
- Multi-provider LLM support via `quality_preset` config (`local_cpu`, `local_gpu`,
  `cloud` / AWS Bedrock)
- Knowledge gap simulation for departed employees
