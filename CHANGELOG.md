## [v0.3.4] — 2026-03-05

### Added

- `sim_clock.py` — Actor-local simulation clock replacing all `random.randint`
  timestamp generation across `flow.py` and `normal_day.py`. Each employee now
  has an independent time cursor, guaranteeing no individual can have two
  overlapping artifacts and allowing genuine parallel activity across the org.

- `SimClock.advance_actor()` — Ambient work primitive. Advances a single actor's
  cursor by `estimated_hrs` and returns a randomly sampled artifact timestamp
  from within that work block. Used for ticket progress, Confluence pages, and
  deep work sessions where no causal ordering exists between actors.

- `SimClock.sync_and_tick()` — Causal work primitive. Synchronizes all
  participating actors to the latest cursor among them (the thread cannot start
  until the busiest person is free), then ticks forward by a random delta.
  Used for incident response chains, escalations, and PR review threads.

- `SimClock.tick_message()` — Per-message Slack cadence ticker. Wraps
  `sync_and_tick` with cadence hints: `"incident"` (1–4 min), `"normal"`
  (3–12 min), `"async"` (10–35 min). Replaces the flat random hour assignment
  in `_parse_slack_messages()` so messages within a thread are always
  chronologically ordered and realistically spaced.

- `SimClock.tick_system()` — Independent cursor for automated bot alerts
  (Datadog, PagerDuty, GitHub Actions). Advances separately from human actors
  so bot messages are never gated by an individual's availability.

- `SimClock.sync_to_system()` — Incident response helper. Pulls on-call and
  incident lead cursors forward to the system clock when a P1 fires, ensuring
  all human response artifacts are stamped after the triggering alert.

- `SimClock.at()` — Scheduled meeting pin. Stamps an artifact at the declared
  meeting time and advances all attendee cursors to the meeting end. Used for
  standup (09:30), sprint planning, and retrospectives.

- `SimClock.schedule_meeting()` — Randomized ceremony scheduler. Picks a
  random slot within a defined window (e.g. sprint planning 09:30–11:00,
  retro 14:00–16:00) and pins all attendees via `at()`.

- `SimClock.sync_and_advance()` — Multi-actor ambient work primitive. Syncs
  participants to the latest cursor then advances all by a shared duration.
  Used for collaborative work blocks like pair programming or design sessions.

### Fixed

- Timestamps across Slack threads, JIRA comments, Confluence pages, bot alerts,
  and external contact summaries were previously generated with independent
  `random.randint(hour, ...)` calls, producing out-of-order and causally
  inconsistent artifact timelines. All timestamp generation now routes through
  `SimClock`, restoring correct forensic ordering throughout the corpus.

---

## [v0.3.0] — 2026-03-04

### Added

- **`org_lifecycle.py` — `OrgLifecycleManager`** — new module that owns all
  dynamic roster mutations. The engine controls every side-effect; LLMs only
  produce narrative prose after the fact. Three public entry points called from
  `flow.py` before planning runs each day:
  - `process_departures()` — fires scheduled departures and optional random
    attrition; executes three deterministic side-effects in strict order before
    removing the node (see below)
  - `process_hires()` — adds new engineer nodes at `edge_weight_floor` with
    cold-start edges, bootstraps a persona, and emits an `employee_hired` SimEvent
  - `scan_for_knowledge_gaps()` — scans any free text (incident root cause,
    Confluence body) against all departed employees' `knowledge_domains` and
    emits a `knowledge_gap_detected` SimEvent on first hit per domain; deduplicates
    across the full simulation run
  - `get_roster_context()` — compact string injected into `DepartmentPlanner`
    prompts so the LLM naturally proposes `warmup_1on1` and `onboarding_session`
    events for new hires and references recent departures by name
    _File: `org_lifecycle.py` (new)_

- **Departure side-effect 1 — Active incident handoff** — before the departing
  node is removed, every active incident whose linked JIRA ticket is assigned to
  that engineer triggers a Dijkstra escalation chain while the node is still
  present. Ownership transfers to the first non-departing person in the chain,
  falling back to the dept lead if no path exists. The JIRA `assignee` field is
  mutated deterministically; an `escalation_chain` SimEvent with
  `trigger: "forced_handoff_on_departure"` is emitted.
  _File: `org_lifecycle.py` — `OrgLifecycleManager._handoff_active_incidents()`_

- **Departure side-effect 2 — JIRA ticket reassignment** — all non-Done tickets
  owned by the departing engineer are reassigned to the dept lead. Status logic:
  `"To Do"` tickets keep their status; `"In Progress"` tickets with no linked PR
  are reset to `"To Do"` so the new owner starts fresh; `"In Progress"` tickets
  with a linked PR retain their status so the existing PR review/merge flow closes
  them naturally. Tickets already handled by the incident handoff are not
  double-logged. Each reassignment emits a `ticket_progress` SimEvent with
  `reason: "departure_reassignment"`.
  _File: `org_lifecycle.py` — `OrgLifecycleManager._reassign_jira_tickets()`_

- **Departure side-effect 3 — Centrality vacuum stress** — after the node is
  removed, betweenness centrality is recomputed on the smaller graph and diffed
  against the pre-departure snapshot. Nodes whose score increased have absorbed
  bridging load; each receives `stress_delta = Δc × multiplier` (default `40`,
  configurable via `centrality_vacuum_stress_multiplier`, hard-capped at 20 points
  per departure). This reflects the real phenomenon where a connector's departure
  leaves adjacent nodes as sole bridges across previously-separate clusters.
  _File: `org_lifecycle.py` — `OrgLifecycleManager._apply_centrality_vacuum()`_

- **New hire cold-start edges** — hired engineers enter the graph with edges at
  `edge_weight_floor` to cross-dept nodes and `floor × 2` to same-dept peers.
  Both values sit below `warmup_threshold` (default `2.0`) so `DepartmentPlanner`
  will propose `warmup_1on1` and `onboarding_session` events organically until
  enough collaboration has occurred to warm the edges past the threshold.
  `OrgLifecycleManager.warm_up_edge()` is called from `flow.py` whenever one of
  those events fires.
  _File: `org_lifecycle.py` — `OrgLifecycleManager._execute_hire()`_

- **`patch_validator_for_lifecycle()`** — call once per day after
  `process_departures()` / `process_hires()` to prune departed names from
  `PlanValidator._valid_actors` and add new hire names. Keeps the actor integrity
  check honest without rebuilding the validator from scratch each day.
  _File: `org_lifecycle.py`_

- **`recompute_escalation_after_departure()`** — thin wrapper called from
  `flow.py._end_of_day()` that rebuilds the escalation chain from the dept's
  remaining first responder after the departed node has been removed. Logs the
  updated path as an `escalation_chain` SimEvent for ground-truth retrieval.
  _File: `org_lifecycle.py`_

- **New `KNOWN_EVENT_TYPES`** — `employee_departed`, `employee_hired`,
  `knowledge_gap_detected`, `onboarding_session`, `farewell_message`,
  `warmup_1on1` added to the validator vocabulary so the planner can propose
  them without triggering the novel event fallback path.
  _File: `planner_models.py`_

- **New `State` fields** — `departed_employees: Dict[str, Dict]` and
  `new_hires: Dict[str, Dict]` added to track dynamic roster changes across
  the simulation; both are populated by `OrgLifecycleManager` and included in
  `simulation_snapshot.json` at EOD.
  _File: `flow.py` — `State`_

- **`simulation_snapshot.json` lifecycle sections** — `departed_employees`,
  `new_hires`, and `knowledge_gap_events` arrays appended to the final snapshot
  so the full roster history is available alongside relationship and stress data.
  _File: `flow.py` — `Flow._print_final_report()`_

- **`org_lifecycle` config block** — new top-level config section supports
  `scheduled_departures`, `scheduled_hires`, `enable_random_attrition`, and
  `random_attrition_daily_prob`. Random attrition is off by default; when
  enabled it fires at most one unscheduled departure per day, skipping leads.
  _File: `config.yaml`_

### Changed

- **`DepartmentPlanner` prompt** — accepts a `lifecycle_context` string injected
  between the cross-dept signals and known event types sections. When non-empty
  it surfaces recent departures (with reassigned tickets), recent hires (with
  warm edge count), and unresolved knowledge domains so the LLM plan reflects
  actual roster state rather than a static org chart.
  _File: `day_planner.py` — `DepartmentPlanner._PLAN_PROMPT`, `DepartmentPlanner.plan()`_

- **`DayPlannerOrchestrator`** — holds a `validator` reference so
  `patch_validator_for_lifecycle()` can update `_valid_actors` before each day's
  plan is generated, without rebuilding the validator on every call.
  _File: `day_planner.py` — `DayPlannerOrchestrator.__init__()`_

- **`flow.py` module-level org state** — `ORG_CHART` and `PERSONAS` are now
  copied into `LIVE_ORG_CHART` and `LIVE_PERSONAS` at startup. All roster-sensitive
  code paths reference the live copies; the frozen originals remain available for
  config introspection. `OrgLifecycleManager` mutates the live copies in place.
  _File: `flow.py`_

---

## [v0.2.0] — 2026-03-04

### Added

- **Enriched `day_summary` SimEvent** — the ground-truth end-of-day record now
  carries structured fields that make it genuinely useful for RAG evaluation.
  Previously `active_actors` was always `[]`; all fields below are now populated
  deterministically by the engine, not inferred by an LLM.
  - `active_actors` — names of everyone who participated in at least one event
  - `dominant_event` — most frequently fired event type for the day
  - `event_type_counts` — full `{event_type: count}` frequency map
  - `departments_involved` — derived from active actors via org chart lookup
  - `open_incidents` — ticket IDs of incidents still unresolved at EOD
  - `stress_snapshot` — `{name: stress}` for active actors only
  - `health_trend` — `"critical"` / `"degraded"` / `"recovering"` / `"healthy"`
  - `morale_trend` — `"low"` / `"moderate"` / `"healthy"`

  Two new `State` fields support this: `daily_active_actors: List[str]` and
  `daily_event_type_counts: Dict[str, int]`, both reset at EOD. Two new helpers —
  `_record_daily_actor()` and `_record_daily_event()` — are sprinkled at every
  event-firing site in `flow.py`.
  _Files: `flow.py` — `State`, `Flow._end_of_day()`, and all event handlers_

- **`planner_models.py`** — pure dataclass layer, no LLM or engine dependencies.
  Defines the full planning type hierarchy used by `day_planner.py` and
  `normal_day.py`:
  - `AgendaItem` — a single planned activity for one engineer on one day
  - `EngineerDayPlan` — full-day agenda with stress level, capacity calculation,
    and `apply_incident_pressure()` to defer low-priority items when an incident fires
  - `DepartmentDayPlan` — dept-level plan: engineer agendas + proposed events +
    cross-dept signals that influenced planning
  - `OrgDayPlan` — assembled from all dept plans after `OrgCoordinator` runs;
    `all_events_by_priority()` returns a flat sorted list for the day loop executor
  - `ProposedEvent` — an LLM-proposed event pending validator approval
  - `ValidationResult` — outcome of a `PlanValidator` check
  - `KNOWN_EVENT_TYPES` — the vocabulary set the validator enforces; novel proposals
    outside this set are logged rather than silently dropped
    _File: `planner_models.py` (new)_

- **`plan_validator.py`** — integrity boundary between LLM proposals and the
  execution engine. Checks every `ProposedEvent` against five rules before the
  engine executes it:
  1. **Actor integrity** — all named actors must exist in `org_chart` or
     `external_contacts`; invented names are rejected with a clear reason
  2. **Novel event triage** — unknown event types are approved if they carry a
     known `artifact_hint` (`slack`, `jira`, `confluence`, `email`), and logged
     as `novel_event_proposed` SimEvents for the community backlog regardless
  3. **State plausibility** — tonally inappropriate events are blocked (e.g. no
     `team_celebration` when `system_health < 40`)
  4. **Cooldown windows** — configurable per-event-type minimum days between firings
  5. **Morale gating** — `morale_intervention` only fires when morale is actually low
     _File: `plan_validator.py` (new)_

- **`day_planner.py`** — LLM-driven planning layer that replaces `_generate_theme()`
  in `flow.py`. Three classes:
  - `DepartmentPlanner` — one instance per department. Receives org theme, 7-day
    dept history, cross-dept signals, current roster with live stress levels, and
    open JIRA tickets. Produces a `DepartmentDayPlan` via structured JSON prompt
    with graceful fallback for unparseable LLM output.
  - `OrgCoordinator` — reads all dept plans and identifies one cross-dept collision
    event per day. Prompt is intentionally narrow — only genuinely motivated
    interactions qualify (e.g. Sales reacting to an Engineering incident).
  - `DayPlannerOrchestrator` — top-level entry point called from `flow.py`.
    Engineering plans first as the primary driver; other depts react to
    Engineering's plan before `OrgCoordinator` looks for collision points.
    Rejected and novel events each produce their own SimEvent types so nothing
    is silently discarded.
    _File: `day_planner.py` (new)_

- **`normal_day.py` — `NormalDayHandler`** — replaces `_handle_normal_day()` in
  `flow.py` entirely. Dispatches each engineer's non-deferred agenda items to typed
  handlers that produce specific artifacts:

  | `activity_type`     | Artifacts produced                                       |
  | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `ticket_progress`   | JIRA comment + optional blocker Slack thread             |
  | `pr_review`         | GitHub bot message + optional author reply               |
  | `1on1`              | DM thread (3–5 messages)                                 |
  | `async_question`    | Slack thread (3–5 messages) in appropriate channel       |
  | `design_discussion` | Slack thread + 30% chance Confluence design doc stub     |
  | `mentoring`         | DM thread + double social graph edge boost               |
  | `deep_work`         | SimEvent only — intentionally produces no artifact       |
  | deferred (any)      | `agenda_item_deferred` SimEvent logging the interruption |

  Falls back to original random Slack chatter if `org_day_plan` is `None`,
  preserving compatibility with runs that predate the planning layer.
  _File: `normal_day.py` (new)_

---

## [v0.1.2] — 2026-03-04

### Changed

- **`_generate_theme()` switched from `PLANNER_MODEL` to `WORKER_MODEL`**
  Theme generation requires only a single sentence output and does not benefit
  from the planner's capacity. Using the 1.5b worker model reduces per-day
  overhead significantly given `_generate_theme()` fires every simulated day.
  _File: `flow.py` — `Flow._generate_theme()`_

### Added

- **Timeout parameter on `OllamaLLM`** — explicit `timeout` value added to
  `build_llm()` to prevent `litellm.Timeout` errors on slower hardware where
  CPU-bound generation can exceed the default 600s limit.
  _File: `flow.py` — `build_llm()`_

---

## [v0.1.1] — 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- **`TypeError: SimEvent.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument '_id'`**
  MongoDB documents fetched via `.find()` in `recall_events()` include internal
  fields (`_id`, `embedding`) that are not defined on the `SimEvent` dataclass.
  These fields are now stripped before constructing `SimEvent` objects.
  _File: `memory.py` — `Memory.recall_events()`_

- **`NameError: name 'prop' is not defined` in `_print_final_report()`**
  The `prop` variable returned by `graph_dynamics.propagate_stress()` was scoped
  locally to `_end_of_day()` but referenced in `_print_final_report()`. It is now
  stored as `self._last_stress_prop` and accessed safely via `hasattr` guard to
  handle runs that exit before `_end_of_day()` is called.
  _File: `flow.py` — `Flow._end_of_day()`, `Flow._print_final_report()`_

### Added

- **`Memory.reset(export_dir=None)`** — clears MongoDB `artifacts` and `events`
  collections, resets the in-memory `_event_log`, and optionally wipes the export
  directory. Re-attaches the `FileHandler` to a fresh `simulation.log` after the
  wipe so logging continues uninterrupted.
  _File: `memory.py`_

- **`--reset` CLI flag** — passing `--reset` when invoking `flow.py` triggers
  `Memory.reset()` with the configured `BASE` export directory before the
  simulation starts, ensuring MongoDB and `/export` always represent the same run.
  _File: `flow.py`_

---

## [v0.1.0] — 2026-03-01

### Added

- Initial release of the OrgForge simulation engine
- MongoDB vector search memory layer (`memory.py`) with Ollama, OpenAI, and AWS
  Bedrock embedding providers
- CrewAI-based daily simulation loop with incident detection, sprint planning,
  standups, retrospectives, and postmortem generation (`flow.py`)
- NetworkX social graph with stress propagation and edge decay (`graph_dynamics.py`)
- Export to Confluence, JIRA, Slack, Git PR, and email artifact formats
- Multi-provider LLM support via `quality_preset` config (`local_cpu`, `local_gpu`,
  `cloud` / AWS Bedrock)
- Knowledge gap simulation for departed employees
